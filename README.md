# PanelGenerator
Create panels for keystone with openscad. The panels do fit (somewhat) to the Jung LS990 series.

Work in progress, do not use it yet, but feel free to review and comment.

I used an existing generator (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1741072) as a starting point. Many mods where required.

The required in-wall mounting box will also be included.

Find the .stl files in the STL folder.
